## Configuration

### Discord Rich Presence
To get your activity to show up on Discord, you'll need to provide:
1.  **Client ID:** The Application ID from your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Or, use our default one! `1360824994149568562`
2.  **Details & State:** The text you want to display.
3.  **Images & Buttons:** The keys for any assets you've uploaded to your Discord application, and the labels/URLs for custom buttons.

> **Note:** Use `{rip}` in the `Details` field to have it automatically replaced by the current rip counter value!

### Rip Counter
To enable the rip counter, you must provide a valid **Rip File Path**.
- This is the full path to a `.txt` file on your computer where the count will be stored (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\rip_count.txt`).

### OBS Widget Integration
The app hosts a local server on port `4200` to provide real-time widgets for your stream.

We also host our own widgets, check those out [here!](https://bloodmoonstudios.xyz/widgets)

1.  In OBS, add a new **Browser** source.
2.  Set the **URL** to one of the following:
    -   **420 Countdown:** `http://localhost:4200/widgets/countdown`
    -   **Rip Counter:** `http://localhost:4200/widgets/ripcounter`
3.  Set the dimensions to the suggested sizes below, or customize as you see fit:
    -   Countdown: `420` width, `210` height
    -   Rip Counter: `220` width, `210` height
4.  Remove everything from the custom css box.
> **Note:** You can customize the look of the counter right in OBS with CSS!
